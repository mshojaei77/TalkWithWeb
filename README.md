I'll create a fun, humanized, and friendly README.md for this RAG Assistant app. Based on the code, it's a Streamlit application that combines retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with web scraping and PDF analysis capabilities.

Key features I should highlight in an accessible way:
- Chat with an AI assistant that can access custom knowledge
- Add web content via URLs
- Upload PDF documents
- The assistant remembers conversation history
- It intelligently searches through your added content

Since the request is for a non-technical, American-style, fun README, I'll:
1. Use casual, conversational language
2. Include some American colloquialisms/expressions
3. Focus on what the app does rather than how it works
4. Add a touch of humor and excitement
5. Make it visually appealing with emojis and formatting
6. Include simple setup instructions without technical jargon
7. Emphasize the benefits and cool use cases

I'll structure it with:
- A catchy title
- Quick intro/tagline
- What it does (in simple terms)
- Cool features
- How to use it
- Simple setup instructions
- Example use cases
